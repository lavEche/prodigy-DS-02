## Overview
The Titanic dataset is a well-known dataset in the field of data science and serves as a valuable resource for exploring and understanding various data analysis. This dataset contains information about the passengers aboard the RMS Titanic, including whether they survived or not, passenger class, age, gender, fare, and more. The dataset is widely used for predictive modeling, hypothesis testing, and exploratory data analysis.

## Bussiness Problem
Perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on Titanic dataset from Kaggle. Explore the relationships between variables and identify patterns and trends in the data.
This repository contains the analysis of the Titanic dataset, a well-known dataset often used for data science and machine learning projects. The analysis explores various aspects of the dataset, including passenger demographics, survival rates, and factors influencing survival.

## Project Overview

The Titanic dataset analysis is done in several stages:
Data Description
Data Cleaning
Feature Engineering
EDA

## Data
`data/`: Contains the dataset files (`train.csv`, `test.csv`, `gender_submission.csv`) and was obtaine from kaggle.
## Data Description

The Titanic dataset consists of multiple columns, each containing specific information about the passengers and their journey aboard the RMS Titanic. Below is a description of the structure of the dataset and an explanation of the meaning and role of each column:

- **PassengerId**: This column serves as a unique identifier for each passenger and ranges from 1 to the total number of passengers.

- **Survived**: The "Survived" column is binary and indicates whether a passenger survived (1) or did not survive (0) the sinking of the Titanic. It is the target variable for survival prediction.

- **Pclass**: "Pclass" represents the passenger class, which can take one of three values (1, 2, or 3). It indicates whether a passenger was traveling in first, second, or third class.

- **Name**: The "Name" column contains the names of passengers, including their titles (e.g., Mr., Mrs., Miss).

- **Sex**: "Sex" represents the gender of the passengers (male or female).

- **Age**: "Age" is the age of the passengers in years. It may contain missing values.

- **SibSp**: "SibSp" denotes the number of siblings or spouses a passenger was traveling with on the Titanic.

- **Parch**: "Parch" indicates the number of parents or children a passenger was traveling with.

- **Ticket**: The "Ticket" column contains the ticket number of each passenger.

- **Fare**: "Fare" represents the passenger's ticket fare or price.

- **Cabin**: "Cabin" contains the cabin number where the passenger was staying. It may contain missing values.

- **Embarked**: "Embarked" represents the port of embarkation and can take one of three values (C, Q, or S) for Cherbourg, Queenstown, or Southampton, respectively.

## Conclusion
- Gender-Based Survival Discrepancy: Females had a notably higher survival rate compared to males, reflecting the adherence to the "Women and Children First" principle during evacuation.

- Passenger Class and Survival:First-class passengers had higher survival rates compared to those in lower classes, emphasizing the socio-economic disparities present during the time of the Titanic's voyage.

- Age Group and Survival: While age did not show as stark a difference as gender and class, there were patterns in survival rates among different age groups. Younger passengers, especially children, had higher survival rates.

- Family Size Impact: Our analysis revealed that passengers traveling with larger families (spouse, siblings, parents, or children) had varying survival rates, suggesting complex dynamics in evacuation decisions.

- Fare and Age Relationship: We observed that ticket fares were not solely determined by passenger class but also by factors such as age, indicating variations in pricing based on individual circumstances.

## Recommendations
Based on our analysis, I offer the following recommendations:

- Safety and Evacuation Training: Future travel and maritime safety protocols should consider incorporating gender-neutral safety training to ensure a fair distribution of survival resources during emergencies.

- Economic Equity: Efforts to promote economic equity should be a priority in the design and allocation of passenger class facilities and resources on modern transportation vessels.

- Family-Centric Planning: Emergency planning should account for the presence of families and their unique needs during evacuation scenarios, ensuring coordinated efforts and resources.

- Fare Transparency: Travel companies should adopt transparent pricing strategies that reflect fare variations based on age, class, and other factors.


 ## Next Steps

- Building predictive models to further explore the relationships between various factors and passenger survival, enabling more accurate predictions.

- Conducting more advanced statistical tests to validate and quantify the significance of the observed relationships.

- Investigating how factors like time of embarkation or seasonality might have influenced passenger decisions and survival.

- Comparing the Titanic dataset with other maritime disaster datasets to identify broader trends and lessons for modern safety measures.
